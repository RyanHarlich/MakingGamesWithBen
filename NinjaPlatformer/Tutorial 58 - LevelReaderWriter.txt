___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
		- IMPORTANT: when making version numbers do not have it be 0 since that is a common number to be in front of a file, this tutorial uses the number 100 for the bytes in front of the file
					- The version is for if there was an update and people had saves from the last version of the game (check out LevelReadWriter::loadAsText)

		-	Binary file loading
		-	Text File saving and loading system
				- human readable text

		Text File Loader Vs Binary File Loader
				- Text File Loader
						- easier
						- not better
				- Binary File Loader
						- more difficult
						- better

		- This tutoral will use a text file loader
		- TODO: In the future use a binary file loader

	Text File Loader

				- Version number
				- Player's info (the stange symbol is his color)
				- Blocks (boolean at end if dynamic)
				- Lights
