Notes:
		- basic 2D lighting
				- this is not going to be true lighting, it is a hacky way
						- complex lightening: shadow mapping, funct shading, and specular shading
								- will be saved for 3D series

		- not real lighting, it is a fake lighting effect


		- it is ok to bind the texture and not use it for a hacky lighting shader
				- but do not get the uniform location, since it does not exist for the lighting shader

		- the light add on is not done properly only for show


		- Standard Blending
				- Here is standard alpha blending that has been used throughout the recent tutorials for alpha:
						glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
	// first parameter is source factor, it is currently going to multiply the soruce factor by 1
	// second parameter is the destination factor, so if source is 1 will get 0
	// will get full color from the source, and no color at the destination



		- Additive Blending
				- adds color to character instead of taking away color hence the name additive blending
						glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE);
						//here the source alpha will be multiplied by one and the destination alpha will always be one



		- Real lighting vs. Linear lighting
				- update is in the lightShading.frag
				- pictures for graphical view are attached (where x is distance)
