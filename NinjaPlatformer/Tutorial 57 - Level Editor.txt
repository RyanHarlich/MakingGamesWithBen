___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
		-	Made a level editor


		- isDynamic, means is the item able to move (true), or is it stuck in place (false) in this context for this tutorial


		-evnt.motion.xrel, evnt.motion.yrel * m_camera.getAspectRatio
		// this makes it so the x motion is not faster than the y motion in case the screen is wider than it is tall

		xrel and yrel has to do with being able to go off the screen instead of stuck in a the original coordinates


		m_selectOffset is so the object does not snap to the middle of the mouse pointer when selected



		notice: when adding one light on top of another the light gets brighter because of the additive blending
