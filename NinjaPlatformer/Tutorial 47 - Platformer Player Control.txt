		-	Definition:

			for (b2ContactEdge* ce = body->GetContactList(); ce != nullptr; ce = ce->next) {}
					- special type of iterator for a edge between two contact points
					- get contact list is a linked list that needs a special type of iteration

			b2WorldManifold 
					- stores all contact points of specific edge

			b2_maxManifoldPoints
					- two contact points for all convex shapes


			Force is force over time, per second, not instantaneous (over frames)
					body->ApplyForceToCenter(,)

			damping: slow down velocity kind of like friction

			Apply instant force
					body->ApplyLinearImpulse(,)


			Player standing on ground
					- loop through all contact points of player
					- everytime player is touching something will have a contact point stored in body
					- determine if a particular contact point is where the player's feet are
