Notes:

		- CEGUI has a SDL to CEGUI conversion table for scan code
				- can copy and paste (most likely)
				- it is for the old SDL so modifications do need to be made!
				- the key pad was not provided in tutorial so would have to look up

		- The SDL to CEGUI mouse button conversion table was made during tutorial


		- '\0' is the null character can also put 0
		

		- The SDL unicode stuff on the CEGUI wiki seems to be all out of date



		- disables the default mouse cursor so only see the CEGUI mouse cursor, 1 means to show the cursor and 0 means to not show the cursor
		SDL_ShowCursor(0);
