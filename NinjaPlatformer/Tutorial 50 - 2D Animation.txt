___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
		-	Sprite sheet
				- numbered
					- 0-9 on the bottom (left to right)
					- 10-19 on the top (left to right)
				- positions:
					- Standing Still: 0
					- Jumping: (16-17)
							rising 16
							falling 17
					- Running: (10-15)
							- note: deltaTime would make this better but ignoring for now
					- On Ground: 0-15, 19


		- Direction
			- left -1
			- right is 1
ex.
	if (m_direction == LEFT) {
		uvRect.x += 1.0f / m_texture.dims.x; // this will add one tile over
		uvRect.z *= -1; // reverese the direction of the uv coordinates, (z is width), in the shader it will be a negative number for the demensions which will cause to go back one tile but backwards
	}






	if (abs(velocity.x) > 1.0f) { // absolute of velocity says to ignore direction



	// Apply animation
	tileIndex = tileIndex + (int)m_anumTime % numTiles; // starts at tile index and gives remainder of the number of tiles



	animSpeed = abs(velocity.x) * 0.025f; // this will cause legs to slow down when velocity slows down
