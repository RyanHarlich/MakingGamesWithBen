Notes:
		- Mistakes from part 1
		- Cannot take the address of a reference, its a C++ 11 safty feature


		WARNING:
		C4099 type name first seen using 'class' now seen using 'struct'
			- this says the forward declaration says:
					class ClassName;
				but is actually a struct, so needs a struct forward declaration
					struct StructName;
