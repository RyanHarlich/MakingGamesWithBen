Notes:
	- As of now there is a bunch a wasted generating sprite batches that are outside
		the camera view and not visable.
	- 3D version is called frustem calling to avoid this behaviour.
	- Camera culling 2D:
		- Determine if the zombies are visable
		- Do this by collision test with the bounding box of the camera with the bounding box of the
			sprite.
		- All action still goes on outside of view
