Updated Files:
	- Added SpritFont.cpp to Bengine
	- Added SpritFont.h to Bengine
	- MainGame.h
	- MainGame.cpp

___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
	- Font rendering (main menu, heads up display, stop using the prompt)
	- True Type Font: type of font can get online, if not installed already (.ttf search C drive)
			- http://www.1001freefonts.com/
			- tutorial uses: http://www.dafont.com/ttf.d592 (have not check to see if it is safe)
	- To be able to render them in the game have to use:
			- SDL_ttf: a library that will render .ttf font to SDL texture
			- Then have to: convert to an openGL texture and render it to the screen
		- this is a little intensive if changing high-resolution font every frame
		- use SDL_ttf to render a bitmap spread sheet
			- takes all the letters you need and renders them to texture (single spreadsheet)
			- map all the different letters to the uv coordinates for that bit map font
			- render a different quad for each box
			- need two triangles for each letter
			- this is better than rerendering the text each time

	- Install SDL_ttf:
		- https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
		- Development Libraries: (Visual C++ 32/64-bit) for visual studio
		- Create a TTF folder in the deps/include, get all the includes, libs, .dll
		- Properties > Linker > input > add the SDL2_ttf.lib
		- SDL_ttf.h will get an error because in the #includes "fileName" need #include <TTF/fileName>

	- SpriteFont .ccp and .h was not gone over. Pre-made. Copied by rewritting.


NEW: 	
char buffer[256];
sprintf_s(buffer, "Num Humans %d", _humans.size()); // will fill the buffer with the following string // visual studio perfers sprintf_s() over sprintf()



Some computers cannot pull to high of resolution so setting size to 64 and setting the scale to high will maximaize quality and texture memory
