Notes:
	- fmod studio is an advanced development library
	- what is used in the lesson is: SDL_mixer
			- https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
				- download the development libraries (Visual C++ 32/64-bit)
					- move include file with all the other SDL .h files
					- move the .lib file
					- move all the .dll to the debug/release bin
					- properties -> linker -> input -> .lib
	- SDL_mixer:
		- is a small library built on top of SDL
		- higher level way of doing audio than the simple SDL audio stuff

	- Handles 2 kinds of audio files: 
		- mix chunck
			- sound effect
		- mix music
			- music file

			note: can play multiple sound effect, but only one music at a time
					- channels can be implemented better but that is not in these tutorials

		CAN GET MUSIC AT: opengameart.org:
			- .ogg is a compressed audio format, it is a very good audio format
			- .wav is good for sound effect
		

NEW: fatalError("Mix_Init error" + std::string(Mix_GetError()));
		since it returns a c string to get a c++ string wrap a string constructor around it



IMPROTANT:	key word friend:
				friend class ClassName;
					- this says that ClassName can use the any of the class's private variables
