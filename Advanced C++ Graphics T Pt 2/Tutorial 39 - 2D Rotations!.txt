Notes:
		- rotation:
			- around the orgin
					- 90 degrees
					- 180 degrees
					- 270 degrees
					- 360 degrees
			- code for full smooth rotation
				- newX = oldX * cos(angle) - oldY * sin(angle)
				- newY = oldX * sin(angle) + oldY * cos(angle)
					- need to use radians: so multiple by pi/180

			- default angle will be facing right towards angle 0
			- 90 is facing up
			- 180 is facing left
			- 270 is facing down

			- determine angle from x-axis (0 radians)

			- use dot product to do this
			    vectors A B
				Ax * Bx + Ay * By

			- to find angle:
				- arccos of dot product
				- look at picture attachment
