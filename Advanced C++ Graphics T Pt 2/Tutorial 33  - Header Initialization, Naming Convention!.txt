Updated Files:
	- MainGame.h
	- also all private members where update to m_variableName

___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
	- Header Initialization is new in C++ 11
	- Can have constructor initialization list and header initializations, first the header initializations will happen then the constructor initialization list will happen
	- Always use header initialization, it is less bug prone

	- Naming convention:
		- private variables underscore _variableName
			- this is not a good convention for C++ because variables with an underscore are reserved by the compiler.
		- INSTEAD:
			- put an m in the front m_variableName
				- the m stands for memmber
