Notes:
	- Rendering particles in a cache friendly way
	- Problem with polymorphism: if two classes each have a variable, the base class would be 1 bytes and the sub-class would be 2 bytes because it has its own variable and the base class variable. So when looping through a base class array that has a bunch of sub-classes in it, it will only be going through 1 byte and not 2 bytes.
