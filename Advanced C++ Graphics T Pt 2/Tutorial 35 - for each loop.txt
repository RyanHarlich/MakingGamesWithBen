Updated Files:
	- MainGame.cpp forgot to delete m_spriteFont;
	- AudoEngine.cpp
			- init fatalError check
			- destory deleteing with for each loops (and some forgot closes)
___________________________________________________________________________________
Notes:
	for each loop
		- use amperstand
		- use . instead of -> because it is a reference operator
		- itertor reference and collection to go through
		- can use a for each loop if it has a defined begin and an end method
		- can use on own self-made class that has a begin and end that returns an iterator
		- not more efficent but more compact in code writing
